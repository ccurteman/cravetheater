    <div class="container-fluid text-white">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm" id="about">Crave is an immersive surrealist theatre company focused on making visually
                and
                emotionally moving contemporary theatre that encourages dialogue about pressing social, economic, and
                political issues.

                Founded by Sarah Marie Andrews and Kylie Jenifer Rose through our mutual love of transformative
                theatre, Crave Theatre Company is passionate about creating theatre for the now tailored to our
                community’s needs, and we use valuable audience feedback to determine each season’s thematic focus.


                This year’s MainStage production, "RED" by John Logan, focuses on the importance of empathy and finding
                a way to use your voice with intention to inspire change in the world around you.


                "RED" is based on Mark Rothko’s painting of his Seagram Murals with his (fictional) assistant Ken. This
                play shows a true craftsman making art with intention and purpose as the world pushes back. To us, what
                is most important about Rothko and Ken is how each character feels about their work as an artist and
                what they want their art to say.

                With that in mind, we want this play to be seen in a way that it hasn’t been seen before, and with the
                permission of the playwright, John Logan, we will be casting two women instead of two men because we
                feel that gender is not what matters in this play and that a female interpretation can reveal different
                layers to this text.

                Our all-female cast production of “RED” performs June 14th-30th, 2019 and will feature the acting
                talent of Maia McCarthy as Mark Rothko and Kylie Jenifer Rose as Ken. ​

                We are also pleased to announce that as part of an Open Residency Program with Shaking the Tree Theatre
                we will be presenting a sitzprobe-style reading of a new devised work: a one woman musical featuring
                Kylie Jenifer Rose in March of 2019 entitled "Bad World." Music and lyrics by Kylie Jenifer Rose and
                James Liptak and book by Emilie Landmann. More details coming soon!

                Also, keep an eye out for announcements about our art classes, movement for actors workshop, and
                devising workshops as we continues to write and develop new works!
